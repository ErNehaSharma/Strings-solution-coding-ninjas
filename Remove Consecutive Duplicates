For a given string(str), remove all the consecutive duplicate characters.
Example:
Input String: "aaaa"
Expected Output: "a"

Input String: "aabbbcc"
Expected Output: "abc"
 Input Format:
The first and only line of input contains a string without any leading and trailing spaces. All the characters in the string would be in lower case.
Output Format:
The only line of output prints the updated string.
Note:
You are not required to print anything. It has already been taken care of.
Constraints:
0 <= N <= 10^6
Where N is the length of the input string.

Time Limit: 1 second
Sample Input 1:
aabccbaa
Sample Output 1:
abcba
Sample Input 2:
xxyyzxx
Sample Output 2:
xyzx

Solution for this is here
def remove_consecutive_duplicates(s):
    result = ""
    lastChar = None

    for c in s:
        if c != lastChar:
            result += c
            lastChar = c

    return result

# Get input from the user
input_string = input()

# Call the function to remove consecutive duplicates
output_string = remove_consecutive_duplicates(input_string)

# Print the resulting string
print( output_string)
